## Overview
This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create new artwork images based on a dataset of famous artworks. It consists of two neural networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, that work together in a competitive setting. The Generator creates new images, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Dataset
The "Best Artworks of All Time" dataset is used for training the GAN model. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and consists of artwork images from various artists. The dataset is processed to resize and normalize images for training.

## Setup
To set up and run the code, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

### Step 2: Download Dataset
Upload your kaggle.json to Google Colab to access the Kaggle API. The code will automatically download the "Best Artworks of All Time" dataset.

### Step 3: Code Structure
- Step 1: Environment Setup – Install necessary packages and set up Kaggle API for dataset download.
- Step 2: Data Preparation – Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Step 3: Model Definitions – Define the Generator and Discriminator models.
- Step 4: Hyperparameters and Model Initialization – Set hyperparameters and initialize models, loss functions, and optimizers.
- Step 5: Training Loop – Train the DCGAN using the provided dataset.
- Step 6: Visualize Generated Images – Display images generated during training.

#### Training
The training loop trains the Generator and Discriminator in an adversarial setting.
Generated samples are saved at specified intervals in the /content/generated_samples directory.
The number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters can be adjusted to suit your dataset and compute resources.
To run the training, simply execute all the cells in the notebook in order. Adjust the num_epochs and sample_interval variables as needed.

#### Visualizing Generated Images
The code includes a section to visualize images generated during the training process. Adjust the num_images variable to control how many images are displayed.

### Results
The model generates artwork images based on the training data. The quality of the generated images improves as the number of training epochs increases. The results can be found in the /content/generated_samples directory.
